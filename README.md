# Advertisement Conversion Rate By Countries

This project uses an advertisement dataset and runs a simple MySQL query to find the conversion rate for countries based on the amount of viewed ads and determines the click through rate.

The advertising.csv dataset is publicly available on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/zohebabai/exploratory-project-on-advertising-dataset/data.
